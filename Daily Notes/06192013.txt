RF TRANSMITTER 
===================================
RF stands for (Radio Frequency), it is an electromagnetic wave between 1-3 GHz.
above that are Microwave frequencies: 3-30 GHz

Power is related to the energy of the wave
Bandwidth is the width of the wave or the period.

-----
FREQUENCY = 1/T (inversely proportional to Period)
F       Period
1Hz = 1 sec
1kHz = 1 millisecond
1 Mhz = 1 microsecond
hertz (wave cycles per second)

UNIT Decibel: is a logarthimic unit indicates the ratio of a physical quantity (usually power or intensity) relative to a specified or implied reference level. A ratio in decibels is ten times the logarithm to base 10 of the ratio of two power quantities.A change in power ratio by a factor of 10 is a 10 dB change. A change in power ratio by a factor of two is approximately a 3 dB change.
The decibel symbol is often qualified with a suffix that indicates which reference quantity or frequency weighting functionhas been used. For example, dBm indicates a reference level of one milliwatt, while dBu is referenced to approximately 0.775 volts RMS.
Alexander Graham Bell

x dBN = 10*log10
1000 = 10^3 = 30 dB
1 = 10^0 = 0 dB
1/1000 000 = - 10^6 = -60 dB
Instead of multiplying things in the linear domain, you can add things in the logarithmic domain. This is useful for very large or very small

APRS TRACKER
==================
APRS (Automatic Position Reporting System)
An APRS tracker takes position information supplied by a (GPS) receiver, 
reformats it as packet radio data,
converts the data to a modulated audio signal,
and passes the signal to a transmitter (typically a VHF FM radio).

At the receiving end, a packet radio Terminal Node Controller (TNC) decodes the 
transmission and feeds the information to a computer running APRS software. 

The BigRedBee: http://www.bigredbee.com/docs/BLGPS/QSTReviewAug07.pdf
The BeeLine: is a tiny (1 1/4 × 3 inch) module 
that contains: a GPS receiver and GPS patch antenna, a Lithium-Poly battery and a 70-cm FM transmitter.
weighs: about 2 ounces.

Trackuino
is a new open source (GPLv2 license) Arduino APRS tracker.
An amateur radio method used to relay small packets of position-tracking data
to an online database for easy access and mapping.
In this case, GPS telemetry data is used to track
latitude, longitude, altitude, course, speed, and time measurements
Data can be tracked in real time on aprs.fi
http://code.google.com/p/trackuino/downloads/list

Trackuino includes
-an onboard radio so no external handheld unit is necessary.
-designed primarily for high-altitude balloon tracking,
-dual temperature sensors,
-support for a humidity sensor,
-and a remote “cut-down” trigger

From previous users, the trackuino can recieve ground signsls from 600Km away

Arduino shield form factor (you can stack more shields on it)
GPS: Venus 638FLPx. Reports okay above 18 Km.
Radio: Radiometrix's HX1 (300 mW).
1200 bauds AFSK using 8-bit PWM
Sends out standard APRS position messages (latitude, longitude, altitude, course, speed and time).

PREDICTION
==================
Knowing
- the ascent rate,
-the burst altitude
-the most current winds data
= the landing spot can be predicted to avoid mired/sea/wood areas.
